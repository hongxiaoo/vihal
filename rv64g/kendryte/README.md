# VIHAL Support for Kendryte K210

The Kendryte K210 is a very powerful 64-bit embedded RISC-V processor at an affordable price.

I own a MaiX Bit and a Maix Dock board. I've begun the development, had a good progress but
once the openocd stopped working and since then I could not connect to JTAG with the openocd (from Kendryte).
I've tried DP Busblaster, J-Link and FT232H. Other boards work with these. My K210 does not.

So I have only a basic UART driver working yet.


Any hints welcome what can I try with the Kendryte openocd...
