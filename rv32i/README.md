# VIHAL Support for 32-bit Risc-V (RV32I)

There are several real boards and FPGA soft-cores available with the RV32I architecture.
I own a Longan Nano (GD32VF) two ESP32-C3 boards and several FPGA Boards which can run soft cores.
I've played a lot with the VexRiscV soft-core and SoC, and made some ready to use variants from that
as VRV100 (https://github.com/nvitya/VRV100).

The driver deveopment is in the early stages now. More progress can be expected here soon.
